# LC-Challenge
A simple yet creative html, CSS and JavaScript project. The cursor moves the elastic horizontal bar, meanwhile what seems to be a seamless loop (no pun intended) of greenish waves rocks the background. A lightheaded rest for your hours long internet journeys. Make the rod bounce as long as you want..

Just download the html and the two directories. Have fun!
