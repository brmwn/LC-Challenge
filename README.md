# LC-Challenge
A simple yet creative html, CSS and JavaScript project. The cursor moves the elastic horizontal bar, meanwhile what seems to be a seamless loop (no pun intended) of greenish waves rocks the background. A lightheaded rest for your hours long internet journeys. Make the rod bounce as long as you want..

Just download the html file and the two directories. Run the html file on your favourite JavaScript-enabled browser.

Have fun!
